What is React?

Answer: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of these components efficiently.

What is JSX?

Answer: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It is used in React to describe what the UI should look like.

What is a component in React?

Answer: A component in React is a reusable piece of UI that can contain both logic and presentation. Components can be composed together to create complex UIs.

What is the difference between state and props in React?

Answer: State is managed internally by a component and can be changed by the component itself. Props (short for properties) are passed to a component from its parent and remain immutable throughout the component's lifecycle.

What is the purpose of setState() method in React?

Answer: setState() is a method used to update the state of a component in React. When setState() is called, React re-renders the component and its children with the updated state.

What is the significance of the virtual DOM in React?

Answer: The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM in React. It allows React to efficiently update and render UI components by minimizing the number of DOM manipulations needed.

What is the role of ReactDOM in React?

Answer: ReactDOM is a package in React that provides methods for rendering React components into the DOM. It is used to mount React components onto the browser DOM.

What are lifecycle methods in React?

Answer: Lifecycle methods are special methods that are invoked at specific points in a component's lifecycle, such as when it is mounted, updated, or unmounted. They allow developers to hook into these lifecycle events and execute code accordingly.

What is the purpose of keys in React lists?

Answer: Keys are special attributes used in React lists to uniquely identify each item in the list. They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed, and optimize the rendering process accordingly.

What is React Router?

Answer: React Router is a popular routing library for React that enables navigation and URL routing in single-page applications. It allows developers to define routes and map them to specific components, making it easy to create multi-page experiences within a single-page app.

What is a functional component in React?

Answer: A functional component in React is a simple JavaScript function that takes props as an argument and returns React elements to describe the UI. Functional components are typically used for presenting UI without managing state.

What is a class component in React?

Answer: A class component in React is a JavaScript class that extends the React.Component class. Class components can have state and lifecycle methods, making them more suitable for complex UI logic and state management.

What is the purpose of the useEffect hook in React?

Answer: The useEffect hook in React is used to perform side effects in function components. It replaces lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components.

What is props drilling in React?

Answer: Props drilling refers to the process of passing props through multiple layers of nested components to reach a deeply nested component where the props are needed. It can lead to code verbosity and maintenance issues.

What is React context?

Answer: React context is a feature that allows data to be passed through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. It provides a way to share values like theme, locale, or authentication state across the entire application.

What is the purpose of the useRef hook in React?

Answer: The useRef hook in React is used to create a mutable ref object that persists for the entire lifecycle of the component. It is often used to access DOM elements or to store mutable values that persist between renders.

What are controlled components in React?

Answer: Controlled components in React are components whose value is controlled by React state. Changes to the input value are handled by React state and reflected in the UI, allowing for more predictable behavior.

What are uncontrolled components in React?

Answer: Uncontrolled components in React are components whose value is managed by the DOM itself rather than by React state. They are typically used for form inputs where you don't need to manage the input value through React state.

What is the purpose of React Fragments?

Answer: React Fragments are used to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They allow you to return multiple elements from a component's render method without needing to wrap them in a container element.

What is the significance of keys in React lists?

Answer: Keys are special attributes used in React lists to provide a stable identity to each list item. They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed, and optimize the rendering process accordingly.

What is React's reconciliation process?

Answer: React's reconciliation process is the algorithm it uses to efficiently update the UI based on changes in component state or props. It compares the previous and current states of the component tree and calculates the minimal set of changes needed to update the DOM.

What are keys and why are they important in React?

Answer: Keys are special attributes used to identify elements in a React list. They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed, improving performance and aiding in maintaining component state.

What is the purpose of conditional rendering in React?

Answer: Conditional rendering allows React components to render different UI elements or components based on certain conditions or states. It helps create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

What is the difference between stateful and stateless components in React?

Answer: Stateful components, also known as class components, manage their own state using the setState method. Stateless components, also known as functional components, do not manage state and are primarily used for UI presentation.

What is the significance of the key prop when rendering lists in React?

Answer: The key prop is used to uniquely identify elements in a React list. It helps React efficiently update the list by determining which items have changed, been added, or been removed.

What is the purpose of the dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute in React?

Answer: The dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute allows you to set the HTML content of a React component directly, bypassing React's usual escaping and rendering mechanisms. It should be used with caution to avoid XSS vulnerabilities.

What is the purpose of the componentDidMount lifecycle method in React?

Answer: The componentDidMount lifecycle method is called after a React component has been mounted (i.e., rendered to the DOM). It is commonly used to perform tasks that require interaction with the DOM or external data fetching.

What is the role of the setState method's callback function in React?

Answer: The callback function passed to setState is called after the state has been updated and the component has been re-rendered. It can be used to perform additional tasks after state changes have been applied.

What is the purpose of the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method in React?

Answer: The shouldComponentUpdate method is called before a component re-renders. It allows the component to control whether or not it should re-render based on changes to its state or props, optimizing performance.

What is the significance of React DevTools?

Answer: React DevTools is a browser extension that allows developers to inspect and debug React component hierarchies, view component state and props, and analyze component performance. It's a valuable tool for React development and debugging.
